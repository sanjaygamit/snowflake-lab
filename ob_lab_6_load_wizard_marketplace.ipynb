As you saw, the dialog includes options to help Snowflake understand the \"shape\" of the data as it is in the source file and specify how the data in the file should be interpreted and processed. This includes the type (e.g. CSV), field delimiters, and whether it contains header lines that should be skipped.\n",

    "\n",
    "Snowflake’s [zero-copy cloning](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-clone) feature provides a convenient way to quickly take a “snapshot” of any table, schema, or database (and other objects) and create a derived copy of that object, which initially shares the underlying storage. This does not involve physically copying any underlying data but is an operation affecting metadata only. For this reason, it is generally very fast to clone tables, schemas, or even entire databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clones are independent objects the moment they are created. You can perform the same operations on the cloned objects you perform on the source objects. For example, you can do anything to a table you cloned, including writing to it or changing parameters using the `ALTER TABLE` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning can be extremely useful for creating instant backups without additional costs (until changes are made to the cloned object). This feature is often used in Snowflake for speedy provisioning of Dev and Test/QA environments and data backups."
